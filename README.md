# Student Management System

In the Student Management system Project in python, we will see a project that manages all the information of the students It includes managing data such as name, email-id, contact number, date of birth, which stream they are in, etc.
In this tutorial of the Python project, we will build a GUI-based Student Management System Project using the Tkinter, SQLite3, tkcalendar, messagebox, and datetime and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate-level project, where you will learn how to use databases, and modules and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life.



## Deployment

Steps for program execution:

1) First Install Pycharm Community Edition 2021.3.1 (community edition is to be installed)

2) Create New Project by clicking on File and selecting New Project, writing the project name, and entering “Create”

3) 3. Right-click on the project name you have created and  Create a New Python File as “studentmanage.py”

4) Write the code in the file and execute the Python Program for the student management system by Clicking the Run tab.


Note: Before Importing the tkcalendar in the program install it by using the command   “ pip install tkcalendar”  and rest libraries that are not imported, by using the terminal/command prompt.

You can also install the modules by going to “File”->” Settings”-> ”Project: New Student Management”->” Python Interpreter”->click on the”+” sign and write the name of the module want to install.

Now let us understand the source code of the Student Management System in Python using Tkinter in detail.
